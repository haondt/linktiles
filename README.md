## Introduction

linktiles is a tile-based read-only frontend for [linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding), which is in turn, a minimal bookmark manager. linktiles uses an api key to fetch links from your linkding instance, and displays them in a configurable mosaic.

For local development, run the dev server:

```shell
python3 generator.py
```
